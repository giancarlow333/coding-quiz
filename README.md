# Javascript Coding Quiz

This app is a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I have written.

## Functionality

```
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Sources

Non-original code in this project:

* I got the idea for using JavaScript Date() functions to update the countdown clock dynamically from [this freeCodeCamp.Org thread](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/javascript-jquery-countdown-timer-with-update-capability/505432).

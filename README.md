# Javascript Coding Quiz

This app is a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I have written.

## Functionality

```
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Sources

Non-original code in this project:

 * I consulted [this StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59408241/how-to-stop-a-running-countdown-timer) on modifying an existing countdown while it's running.  In particular, user Ajay's code made me realize I needed to place the timeInterval variable as a global variable.
